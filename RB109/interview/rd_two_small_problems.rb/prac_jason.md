- nice work making sense of awful question. Nice poise.
- talking me through it
  - examples
  - dealing with substrings:
  1. generate all possible substrings (from input)
  2. search thru list, see if any ss, when repeated up to length of input, are eql?
  3. keep track of number of times we repeat
  4. store items: times repeated and sub_str
  5. from cache, we can search for sub_str w shortest length*
  
  ~ 10 minute mark

  Algo: 
  - Nice use of helper, initialize vs. define
  - very quick in this portion, continually spoke through process, slightly verbose psuedo-code but on the whole, very good. 

  ~ 20 minute mark

  - using hash as a cache 
  - will have all possible substrings, search through cache

CODING
  - very quick implementation of helper,
  - updating algoritm as you code: good practice
