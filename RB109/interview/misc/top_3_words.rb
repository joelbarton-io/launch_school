# Write a function that, given a string of text (possibly with punctuation and line-breaks), returns an array of the top-3 most occurring words, in descending order of the number of occurrences.

# Assumptions:
# A word is a string of letters (A to Z) optionally containing one or more apostrophes (') in ASCII.
# Apostrophes can appear at the start, middle or end of a word ('abc, abc', 'abc', ab'c are all valid)
# Any other characters (e.g. #, \, / , . ...) are not part of a word and should be treated as whitespace.
# Matches should be case-insensitive, and the words in the result should be lowercased.
# Ties may be broken arbitrarily.
# If a text contains fewer than three unique words, then either the top-2 or top-1 words should be returned, or an empty array if a text contains no words.


EXPLICIT
  -> words are CASE INSENSITIVE
  -> words can have one or more apostrophes but other special characters are not to be counted
  
WORD -> string of letters (potentially including one or more apos)

ds: str phrase -> array of words deleting all non-apostrophes special chars -> clean words arr -> hash -> get max value'd element in hash

algo:

CONVERT phrase -> array

TRAVERSE array of words
  check for and delete all special characters (not including aposphtoes)
NOW we have clean words


TRAVERSE array of clean words-> populating hash object with uniq elements
GET max 3 values
