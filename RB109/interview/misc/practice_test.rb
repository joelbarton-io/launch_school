Problem 1
find all the primes between zero and a given number and return them in an array

p find_primes(100) = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]

Problem 2
Count the lowercase letters in a given string and return the letter count in a hash with the letter as a key and the count as a value.

p letter_count('arithmetics') ==  {:a=>1, :c=>1, :e=>1, :h=>1, :i=>2, :m=>1, :r=>1, :s=>1, :t=>2}
