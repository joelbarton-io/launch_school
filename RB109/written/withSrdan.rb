breath.  read.  intent.

## Process for written
1. Read for general problem understanding: be specific
2. [Optional] For **longer answers**, write bullet points of things you need to include
3. Write the direct answer (output/return value)
4. Elaborate, breaking into paragraphs for different concepts
5. Look for any main concepts


notes from study session:

in general:
- around 20 question, 3 hrs
- time limit is main problem for most people
- split into paragraphs: line numbers, variables names, objects

common mistakes:
- must be precise about what code is returning what value
- initialize, reassignment
- explain every relevant line of code, nothing more, nothing less
- explain code in its logical order (invocation/initialization first)

Interview:
- 2 problems, 1 hour, less than 25 minutes per answer, easy and medium
- watch the videos, try to solve the problems on your own
- follow a process, write the algorithm, check the test case
