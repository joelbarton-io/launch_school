Basically it's because we are trying to call an instance method defined in the Book class on an
instance variable from another class (Library). When we try to invoke the display_data instance
method on the library object community_library, we will get a NoMethodError. What we really want
to do is iterate over the array referenced by @books and call display_data on each Book object,
since display_data is a method intended to be called on Book objects.
