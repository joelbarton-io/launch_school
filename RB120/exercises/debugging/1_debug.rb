# Basically it's because we are trying to call an instance method defined in the Book class on an instance variable
# from another class (Library). When we try to invoke the display_data instance method on the library object community_library,
# we will get a NoMethodError. What we really want to do is iterate over the array referenced by @books and call display_data
# on each Book object, since display_data is a method intended to be called on Book objects.
