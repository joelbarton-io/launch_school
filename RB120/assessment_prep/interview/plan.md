my plan on March 4th:

- review vahid's article on the core concepts
- keep practicing and explaining concepts to others; debug hard problems
- attend another spot session; another TA-led as well? maybe.
- revise 'concepts.md' file; make more concise for interview, then review
- integrate feedback from written exam into how I talk/approach problems
- try to figure out what kind of problems they might ask
