my plan on March 4th:

- [x] review vahid's article on the core concepts
- [] keep practicing and explaining concepts to others; debug hard problems
- [] attend another spot session; another TA-led as well? maybe.
- [] revise 'concepts.md' file; make more concise for interview, then review
- [x] integrate feedback from written exam into how I talk/approach problems
- [x] try to figure out what kind of problems they might ask
- [x] get advice from people who've already passed

- try to schedule more with new people
