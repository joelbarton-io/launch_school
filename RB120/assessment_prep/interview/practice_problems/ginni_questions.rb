code flexibility, reduced repeated code, and being able to think at a greater

# What are modules? When is it appropriate to use them?

=begin
modules are similar structures to classes in that they can store
methods, constants, and various types of variables. however, they
cannot be instantiated; we cannot create an instance of a module
in the way we would a class.

When working with modules, there are three primary uses cases.
Mixins, namespacing, and module methods.

A mixin is module we use to store some desired behavior that
we can then include into a class' definition, thus making that
behavior accessible to instances of that class and subclass
instances of that class. (interface inheritance).

A using a module as a namespace essentially provides a shared
space for similar classes to occupy together
=end

# What are modules? When is it appropriate to use them?

# instances of the Module class; cannot be used to instantiate new objects; do not inherit behaviors from a superclass

# module A; end

# p A.ancestors # [A]

# What is the attr_accessor method, and why wouldnâ€™t we want to just add attr_accessor methods for every instance variable in our class?

# instance method defined in the Module class; metaprogramming; creates two instance methods (attribute getter/setter)
# we wouldn't add an attr_accessor for every instance variable in our class because sometimes we don't want to expose the
# internal state of our objects, since this is the point of accessor methods, it makes sense why we wouldn't always
# want to have both accessors for all of an object's attributes.
# class Person
#   attr_writer :age
#   attr_accessor :name

#   def initialize(name, age)
#     @name = name
#     @age  = age
#   end
# end

# joe = Person.new("Joe", 65)

# p joe.name
# joe.name = "anya"
# p joe.name

# joe.age = 66

=begin
How is Method Access Control implemented in Ruby? Provide examples of when we would use public,
protected, and private access modifiers.

designate some method or methods as being of a certain visibility.

# class Person # public interface is comprised of the :name getter and setter methods
#   def initialize(name)
#     @name = name
#   end

#   def ==(other)
#     name == other.name
#   end

#   protected

#   attr_accessor :name
# end

# joe = Person.new("Joe")
# sal = Person.new("Sal")

# p joe == sal
# p joe.name
# joe.name = "Joseph"
# p joe.name

# instance only? or class methods too?

# those instance methods which are capable of being exposed from outside of the class; as in upon an object of that class (or obj of subclass)

=begin
Why is it generally safer to invoke a setter method (if available) vs. referencing the instance
variable directly when trying to set an instance variable within the class? Give an example.

safer? -> human error catching with method lookups vs initialization of a new instance variable
also, it's a better practice to be sending and receiving messages (invoke methods) versus direct implementation (directly ref @i-var)

# class Person
#   attr_writer :name

#   def initialize(name)
#     @name = name
#   end

#     # @naem = new_name # create a new instance variable, assigning it to the passed-in string value
#   end

Give an example of when it would make sense to manually write a custom getter method vs. using attr_reader.

custom getter > attr_reader

: -> say over how state information is presented

#     @address = address
#     @name    = name

#   attr_reader :name

#     @address.last(2).join(" ") # by defining a custom getter, we have more control over how state information is shared/displayed

What is the difference between states and behaviors?

behavior -> method (attr_reader, some_method, class_method)

# How do class inheritance and mixing in modules affect instance variable scope?
# Give an example.

=begin
They don't. Instance variables are scoped at the object level.  Attribute getters/setters on the other hand are methods and thus inherited
and influenced by class inheritance and mixin modules.

If an instance variable is initialized under an objectâ€™s execution, it is scoped to that object.

Therefore, the scope  of instance variables is the

How does encapsulation relate to the public interface of a class?

public interface of a class consists of the public methods available to be exposed from outside the class
classes encapsulate behaviors; we can use access modifiers to further encapsulate behavior and limit the public interface of a class.

Describe the distinction between modules and classes.

modules -> do not 'inherit' behaviors in the way that classes can inherit via class inheritance
  - mixins, namespacing, module methods
  - bundle related classes, or methods and constants, or a module method

classes -> can be use to instantiate objects; by default subclass from Object
  - group a set of behaviors for an object
