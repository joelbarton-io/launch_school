1. What's the focus of the question? (intent)
2. What's the most simple way I can explain this that completely addresses the intent of the question.
# abstraction
- In general, abstraction allows us to separate implementation from interface; complex aspects of implementation are hidden away and what we are left with is interface, or the ability to send messages and use class structures and objects.
- the whole ability to model real-world concepts or ideas is the backbone of OOP design and this is all because of abstraction
- the main benefits are the ability to write cleaner, more organized, less dependant code that's easier to maintain and think about at a higher level.

# classes and objects
### class
- used to specify the form of an object; combining data representation and methods for accessing and modifying that data wrapped into one.

- classes provide an outline of the form that an object of that class can take

- where we define an object’s attributes and behaviors -> instance_variables and instance_methods
- can 'act' via class methods (which are inherited by all subclasses)
- Classes are used as blueprints for objects; they're where we define an object's behaviors and attributes.
- Ruby defines the attributes (attr getters/setters) and behaviors of its objects in classes.
- We also define class methods inside of classes and can instantiate objects from classes via the `::new` class method. Classes can inherit the behavior of superclasses;
### object
- instance of a class; has a unique state and id

- instance variables track information related to the object (instance variables are scoped at the object-level)
- the sum of which comprises its state, ‘acts’ via instance methods
### benefits of classes and objects
- open up a new world of possibilities; encapsulation, polymorphic behavior, inheritance, working at a greater level of abstraction, and all the benefits of OO re: data privacy/hiding and access control

- using objects allows us to think at a higher level of abstraction; users of a class don’t have to know all the implementation details, they just access the public interface of the class. This has the benefit of preventing unintentional manipulation of data or invoking methods erroneously. → encapsulation of behavior (access control)
- classes allow us to model naturally hierarchical domains, group methods we want available to certain objects, implement polymorphic behavior via (class) inheritance and duck typing, and encapsulate behaviors
- objects encapsulate their own state, therefore we can expose state info if we have access to instance methods since instance variables are scoped at the object level and thus are accessible to instance methods of the object in question

### implementation
- classes encapsulate common behaviors; objects encapsulate state information
- the only way to access an object’s internal state is thru exposing some behavior available to the instance
```ruby
class Runner
  attr_accessor :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def run # a behavior available to all Runner objects
    p "#{@name} is running #{speed} MPH!"
  end

  def set_speed=(speed) # public method
    @speed = speed
  end

  private

  attr_reader :speed # private method (encapsulating behavior via MAC)
end

joe = Runner.new("Joel")
p joe.name  # expose state information about joe via getter method defined in the Runner class' public interface
joe.set_speed = 15  # assign @speed instance variable to a value; thus updating the state of joe
joe.run  # accessing state information (@name's value) and invoking private method speed; thus
joe.speed  # attempt to expose behavior from outside the class; observing method access control at work
```
# attributes and instance variables and state
- An instance variable is named by the class, but each object created from the class creates its own copy of the instance variable, and its value contributes to the overall state of the object.

- The instance variable is actually not a part of the class, and cannot be inherited. The subclass only knows about the variable name, and it uses that name as a reference to the value it points to.
- An attribute is an instance variable name along with it's value. It only does us any good if there is either an associated getter or setter method or both.
- The getter and setter methods are inherited, but the attribute behind these does not get inherited.
- Every object has a state. This is the collection of all instance variables and their values as defined for an individual object. It is part of the object, and not the class, and therefore is not inherited.
### excerpt from TRPL:

"These pairs of accessor methods are known as attributes and are distinct from instance variables. The methods defined by a class may have “public,” “protected,” or “private” visibility, which affects how and where they may be invoked."

### state and instance variables
- initialization is a prerequisite for an instance variable to be part of an object's state.
-
```ruby
class Parent
  attr_accessor :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end

class Child < Parent; end
```
- Child INHERITS behaviors from Parent -> `name` and `initialize`

- methods allow us to expose the attributes of an object since `Child` inherits the behavior of `Parent` and since this (public) behavior facilitates access to an object's attributes, we can access state information of our objects
- if we understand attributes as the behaviors that facilitate

# attr_*
- an abbreviated way of writing setter and getter methods

- by defining `attr_*` methods, we automatically define instance variables of the same name
```ruby
class Person
  attr_accessor :name, :age
end
joel = Person.new # instantiate a new Person object
# --------------- uninitialized instance variables reference `nil`
p joel.name # nil
p joel.age # nil
# --------------- use setters to initialize them
joel.name = "Joel" # => Joel
joel.age = 25      # setter methods always return arg
# --------------- once initialized, our getters return the value associated with the attribute for the individual object that calls it (the method)
p joel # => #<Person:0x00007fb97380c5a8 @name="Joel", @age=25>
```
# calling setters and getters
# instance methods versus class methods
- both are inherited by subclasses

### instance
- defined for and called on instances of a class; available to objects of a class and any inheriting subclass’ object

- mechanism by which objects are encapsulated since the only way to expose an object's state is via instance methods

### class
- defined for and called on a classes; they are the behavior available to a class

- functionality that does not pertain to individual objects of the class
- use if the functionality doesn't deal with the states of indiv. objects
```ruby

class Person
  @@total_people = 0

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
    @@total_people += 1
  end

  def self.total_people
    "total people: #{@@total_people}"
  end

  def print_name
    puts @name
  end
end

joe = Person.new("Joe")
sarah = Person.new("Sarah")
franz = Person.new("Franz")

p Person.total_people
[joe, sarah, franz].each(&:print_name)
```
# referencing and setting instance variables vs. using getters and setters
From outside the class, it is impossible to directly reference instance variables since i-vars are scoped at the level of the object. This is why we need getters and setters (attributes) to facilitate exposing, accessing, and modifying values stored as state in our objects. If an accessor is public, it can be invoked both inside and outside the class by objects of that class or subclass.

- within the class, acessors are preferred to explicitly accessing or assignment of instance variable
  - more flexible and easy-to-maintain code (single point of adjustment)
  - explicitly referencing instance variables doesn't have the built-in protection like an accessor does
  - guard clauses; option to further mediate how some information is exposed
  - using methods relies on sending messages which is preferred to explicit assignment
```ruby
class Fugitive
  attr_accessor :name, :age

  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end

  def change_something
    @name = "Abagnale"
    @namee # if we had used a getter here, it would have thrown an error bc of our spelling error
  end

  def change_something_else
    @agee = 17
  end
end

frank = Fugitive.new("Frank", 21)

p frank.change_something
p frank.change_something_else
```
# polymorphism
- the ability of objects of different types to respond to the same interface

- When we don't care what type of object is calling the method, we're using polymorphism.
- **benefits**: more readable, manageable, and efficient (less redundant) code
- allows us to treat objects of different types as a single generic type of object with respect to invocation of the common interface. In other words, there’s a real sense in which I don’t really care what the object is so long as it can respond to the same method invocation with the same number of arguments.
- The real power of polymorphism is when we can produce different responses from a singular method call, with the response being determined by the type of object calling the method.
- If multiple objects of different types respond to the same interface (or “message”), we’ve got polymorphism, assuming their responses have similar intentions.

### via class inheritance
```ruby
class Sport
  def stretch
    'general stretching routine'
  end
end

class BasketBall < Sport; end

class Soccer < Sport; end

class Running < Sport
  def stretch
    'running stretches' # polymorphism via method overriding + inheritance
  end
end
[Sport.new, Basketball.new, Soccer.new, Running.new].each(&:stretch)
```
### via interface inheritance
```ruby
module Passable
  def pass; end
end

class Sport; end # superclass

class BasketBall < Sport # sub
  include Passable
end

class Soccer < Sport # sub
  include Passable
end

class Running < Sport; end # sub
```
### via duck-typing
```ruby
class SportsGame
  def play(attendees)
    attendees.each(&:attend)
  end
end

# define classes for each type of object that attends the sports game
class Athlete
  def attend
    puts "Plays Sport!"
  end
end

class Fan
  def attend
    puts "Cheers and eats popcorn!"
  end
end

class Vendor
  def attend
    puts "Sells hotdogs!"
  end
end

SportsGame.new.play([Athlete.new, Fan.new, Vendor.new]) # informal grouping based on their shared interface (attend)
```
- if blanking, think of a bunch of different professionals who all `work`

- no formal relationship between classes/types; however if they can both respond to the same interface, we have polymorphism via duck-typing
- A way for objects to behave polymorphically when they do not share methods via either interface or class inheritance.
- The idea is that you don't need to know the type of object in order to invoke an existing method on the object-if it can respond to a method, you can invoke that method on it.

# encapsulation
- is achieved by creating objects and exposing interfaces

- hiding pieces of functionality and data

- facilitates boundaries within our code; class-level, object-level

- helps to ensure data cannot be modified or changed without an obvious intent

### quotes

- 'hiding something behind an interface'

- 'the object is an encapsulation of state and behavior'

- selectively exposing behaviors (classes and access control) and states (via methods)

- the only way to interact with objects is by invoking their methods; instance methods are the only way we can expose data (values) stored as state(referenced by instance variables which are scoped at the object-level).
- There is no way to access the instance variable directly except through the object (direct access must occur in instance methods defined within the class). This is useful because it allow us to set safeguards on data access in order to ensure it is always returned or changed in an appropriate manner.
```ruby
class Car
  def initialize(speed); @speed = speed; end

  def start_car # part of the public interface
    # invoke a bunch of private methods related to starting a car
  end

  def drive # part of the public interface
    # implement drive functionality
  end

  def check_speed
    puts "You are currently going #{speed}"

  private

  attr_reader :speed

  def battery; end

  def ignition_switch; end

  def starter_relay; end

  def battery_cables; end

  def starter_motor; end
end
```
The methods available to an instance of `Car` comprise the public interface of the class. Via method access control, all the specific implementation details involved with how to start a car are encapsulated, meaning that we cannot call them directly on an instance of our `Car` class. This is encapsulation of behavior at the class definition level; all the specific implementation re: how to start our car is encapsulated through the use of `private` and their functionality can only be exposed within the class itself by methods within the class.

# method access control
- access modifiers; further encapsulate behaviors
- allows us to limit what is included in our class' public interface, which is a goal of encapsulation and OO in general
  -> simplifies how users interact with class

### public
- all the instance methods that comprise the public interface of a class

### private
- doesn't allow for an explicit caller!

```ruby
class House
  attr_reader :owner, :price

  def initialize(owner, price)
    @owner = owner
    @price = price
  end

  def to_s
    "#{owner}'s house costs: $#{price}"
  end

  private :price
end
```
### protected
- working with multiple instances of a class

- want to avoid exposing a class’ interface to the rest of our program
- inside class, a `protected` instance method behaves like a `public` method, but when we are *outside* of the class, a `protected` method behaves exactly like a `private` method
- “protected methods come in handy when we want to work with multiple instances of the same class within the same method call, but yet we don't want to expose the interface to the outside world.”
```ruby
class House
  attr_reader :owner, :price

  def initialize(owner, price)
    @owner = owner
    @price = price
  end

  def >(other)
    price > other.price
  end

  protected :price
end
joel = House.new("joel", 12)
rich = House.new("rich", 100)

p joel > rich
```
# modules
- They are used in two primary capacities. One: as namespaces and two: as mixins. A module that's being used as a namespace is a container for a bunch of similar, or related classes whereas a mixin is a module that we use to give various classes desired behaviors, access to constants, and other functionality related concerns. We mix-in functionality to a class via interface inheritance. Modules cannot inherit from other modules nor can be used to instantiate objects.

- A common visual distinction between the two would be that a mixin module would follow the suffix "-able" naming convention while a namespace's name would typically relate to some shared trait or enclosing purpose that the classes contained therein have.

### benefits
- Ruby’s way of implementing multiple inheritance; we can include as many `mixins` as we need

- if we had two Classes of the same name that were unrelated, we could group these two classes in namespace modules to ensure that we don’t experience any name collisions and improve the organization of our code.


# method lookup path
- the ‘path’ Ruby takes while seeking to resolve a method invocation; Ruby searches for a method with the name of the invoked method, first in the class of the object we invoked the method on, then in any modules, then the superclass.

- important because of method overriding. Say we define a method in a class and later include a module into that class that has a method of the same name as the one we defined in our class. Now lets say we want to invoke the method defined in the included module. Because of the order in which the method lookup path searches, the method we defined in our class will be found first and thus called on our object. This was not the desired behavior and underlines the importance or impact that the method lookup path has on our code.
- also tightly related to polymorphism and inheritance.
```ruby
module Greetable
  def greet
    'hi there'
  end
end

class Person
  include Greetable
  def greet
    'well hello there good sir!'
  end
end
Person.new.greet # => well hello there good sir!
# Person#greet is found first and thus overrides Greetable#

```
# collaborator objects
- any object that makes up part of the state of another object (of a different class); the mechanism by which this (formal) relationship is established is through the use of `@instance_variables`

- A collaborator object is the value referenced by another object’s instance variable
- With regard to actual objects in memory, *collaboration* occurs when one object is added to the state of another object (i.e., when a method is invoked on an object). However, a more helpful mental model is: *the collaborative relationship exists in the design (or intention) of our code*
- at a macro level, collaborator objects represent the connections or relationships between various composite parts of your program

- Benefit → by coupling different class' instances via collaborators, we modularize the problem domain into cohesive connected pieces that are more abstracted than just basic data-structures and standard library types
- Detriments → they add more contingency to our code; can be harder to read/process at a glance
```ruby
class SoccerBall
  attr_accessor :moving

  def initialize(moving: false)
    @moving = moving
  end

  def to_s
    moving.to_s
  end
end

class SoccerPlayer
  include Comparable, Enumerable, Math
  attr_accessor :ball

  def initialize(name, ball)
    @name = name
    @ball = ball
  end

  def dribble
    ball.moving = true
  end

  def stop
    ball.moving = false
  end

  def to_s
    "#{@name} and his ball's state: #{ball}"
  end
end
```
# super
- "specified arguments are then sent up the method lookup chain"
- looks for a method with the same name as the one where it is being used within the inheritance hierarchy of the calling object's class
- The super keyword looks up the ancestors chain for the method name where super is called

- three implementations:
    1. `super` passes all `args` of its enclosing method to the superclass’ implementation
    2. `super()` passes exactly zero `args` to superclass’ implementation of the enclosing method
    3. `super(*args)` passes specified args to a superclass’ implementation of the enclosing method
### super
- passes all arguments provided it to the method in the superclass
```ruby
class Card
  def greet
    'Greetings!'
  end
end

class HolidayCard < Card
  def greet
    'Seasonal ' + super
  end
end
```
### super()
- passes exactly zero arguments to the method in the superclass
```ruby
class Card
  def greet
    'Greetings!'
  end
end

class HolidayCard < Card
  def greet(message)
    "Seasonal " + super() + ' ' + message
  end
end
p Card.new.greet                         # 'Greetings!'
p HolidayCard.new.greet('Merry Xmas!') # 'Seasonal Greetings! Merry Xmas!'
```
### super(*args)
- passes `*args` to superclass method
```ruby
class Card
  def greet(message)
    'Greetings!' + ' ' + message
  end
end

class HolidayCard < Card
  def greet(personal_message, date)
    date + "Seasonal " + super(personal_message)
  end
end
p Card.new.greet('Merry Xmas!')                         # 'Greetings! Merry Xmas!'
p HolidayCard.new.greet('Merry Xmas!', "March 3rd: ") # 'March 3rd: Seasonal Greetings! Merry Xmas!'
```
# method lookup path
- the ‘path’ Ruby takes while seeking to resolve a method invocation; Ruby searches for a method with the name of the invoked method, first in the class of the object we invoked the method on, then in any modules, then the superclass.

- important because of method overriding. Say we define a method in a class and later include a module into that class that has a method of the same name as the one we defined in our class.

  def greet
    'well hello there good sir!'
  end
end
Person.new.greet # => well hello there good sir!
# Person#greet is found first and thus overrides Greetable#greet
```

# self

- special variable; describes the context of execution by referencing the object calling the currently executing code
- used to disambiguate when we are calling a setter method versus initializing a new local variable within some instance method
- a way of being explicit about what our program is referencing and what our intentions are as far as behavior
```ruby
class Person
  self

  def a_method
    self
  end

  def self.a_class_method
    self
  end

  def other_method(new_name)
    self.name = new_name
  end
end
```
# fake operators and equality
- many 'operators' are actually instance methods

- it is very common to define a custome `==` method for user-defined classes so that we can be specific about how we implement comparisons of instances of the class

- it is also common to define a custom <=> method, include Comparable and use the inherited methods from the mixin
```ruby
class House
  attr_reader :price

  def initialize(price)
    @price = price
  end

  def ==(other)
    price == other.price
  end
end

my_house   = House.new(10)
your_house = House.new(11)
my_house == your_house
```
# reading OO code
# goal of inheritance
Inheritance lets us reduce writing duplicate code by only defining functionality in one place. By using classes and modules, we can establish formal relationships between various parts of our code, allowing us to define a class in terms of another class.
- with class inheritance, we extract some common behavior to a superclass that other, more specific classes can subclass all of which have this shared behavior
- if we only want certain subclass to have some behavior, but not all, then interface inheritance is probably the right decision since we can selectively `include` that behavior where it's needed without writing code in multiple places

What are some rules/guidelines when writing programs in OOP?

- bundle common behaviors (classes, modules)
- DRY code; reduce repetition
- objects are sending and receiving messages; implementation shouldn't be that visible to our objects (explicit, hardcoded implementation: assigment of variable)
- single responsibility for our methods (does print something or does return a meaningful value)
- strive for using inheritance intelligently, meaningfully
