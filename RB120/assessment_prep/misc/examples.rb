There's a dental office called Dental People Inc.  Within this office, there's 2 oral surgeons, 2 orthodontists, 1 general dentist.
Both general dentists and oral surgeons can pull teeth. Orthodontists cannot pull teeth.  Orthodontists straighten teeth.
All of these aforementioned specialties are dentists. All dentists graduated from dental school.  Oral surgeons place implants.
General dentists fill teeth

Implement a chess game that includes a Board two Player objects a core Chess class and Piece objects

general behaviors
Pieces should be able to move
Board should be shareable or viewable by both players
Player objects should be able to make moves and view the current state of the board
Each time you start a new game, the board should be established as a fresh board

Core collaborators?  What are the main relationships? What classes do we want to associate tightly?

Trade-offs of collaborator objects? (closely associating multiple classes)
