RPSGame.new(3).start_game

=begin
I chose to create a Score class from which I could instantiate score objects.
My rationale for this decision is maintaining consistency.  Since I'm using a
Move object to handle all move-related actions, using a Score object felt right.

I noticed my RPSGame class getting fairly bloated with display-ish methods that
were heavy with puts statements, string interpolations, and method chaining.  This
was leading to quite a few ABC-complexity issues (one method scored above 40!) along
with general loss of readability/maintainability.  I decided to extract every method
that involved displaying final result/current scores/etc. into a Displayable module.

I wanted to keep things simple with this assigment and focus on thinking about spending
time thinking about the core OO concepts.

One of the issues I see in my code is some redundancy in some of my methods in the Displayable
module. In general, this doesn't feel like that much of a problem.  It's likely better to
have too many methods than too few taking on too much responsibility.
