re: https://launchschool.medium.com/object-passing-in-ruby-pass-by-reference-or-pass-by-value-6886e8cdc34a 

- all programming languages use some sort of evaluation strategy. Ruby exclusively uses *strict evaluation*
  - pbr and pbv are to the two most subtypes of *strict*
- in my mind, the terms 'alias' and 'copy' can obfuscate the meaning of pass by value and pass by reference
- didn't have a lot of notes for this article; will definitely return to it further down the road
