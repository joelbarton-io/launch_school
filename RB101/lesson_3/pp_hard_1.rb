# Q 1. 
# i expect a NAME ERROR since greeting is never initialized 

      # WRONG!!!
      
      # normally, my answer is correct.  HOWEVER, when a local
      # variable is initialized within an if/else/while/for/unless/case
      # block (EVEN IF that block is never executed), the ruby parser
      # assigns it the value of nil within its scope
      # 

# Q 2. 
# line 1: assigning label to hash object
# line 2: instantiating label that references value in greetings object
# line 3: mutating string object referenced by informal_greeting
# line 4:
# line 5: prints informal greeting => 'hi there'
# line 6: prints { a: 'hi there' }

# Q 3. 
# Q 4.
