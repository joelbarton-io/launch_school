# jargon
- "PR"
- "continuous integration tests", "functional tests"
- "ATDD tool", "TDD"
- "new matcher syntax"
- "Rspec"
- "unit tests", "controller tests"

# unit testing
- ...is what we are learning
- we are just going to be testing simple classes

# vocabulary
- "domain specific language" (DSL) ex: `RSpec`
- "test" : context within which tests are run; can contain multiple assertions
- "test suite" : all the tests that accompany a project
- "assertion" : actual verification step; "did we get what we expected?"; a test contains one or more

- assert-style syntax (car_test.rb) ; more intuitive for Ruby beginners

- expectation (spec)-style syntax ; appeases RSpec users (`describe`...)
